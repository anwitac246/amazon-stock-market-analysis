# Quantitative Stock Market Analysis Platform

## Overview

A comprehensive Python-based financial analysis platform designed for institutional-grade equity research, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading strategy development. The system implements advanced quantitative methods for portfolio risk management, technical analysis, and systematic trading signal generation.

## Key Features

### Risk Analytics
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** calculation at 95% and 99% confidence levels
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** for tail risk assessment
- **Maximum Drawdown** analysis for worst-case scenario planning
- **Sortino Ratio** computation focusing on downside risk
- **Volatility modeling** with rolling window analysis

### Technical Analysis
- **Moving Average Crossover** signals (20, 50, 200-day)
- **MACD momentum** indicators with signal line analysis
- **RSI oscillator** for overbought/oversold conditions
- **Bollinger Bands** volatility-based mean reversion
- **Composite signal generation** using majority voting algorithm

### Strategy Development
- **Multi-indicator trading system** with systematic signal generation
- **Comprehensive backtesting framework** with transaction cost modeling
- **Market phase analysis** across different economic cycles
- **Performance attribution** and benchmark comparison
- **Portfolio optimization** with risk-adjusted returns

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Data Processing Engine**: Handles historical price data ingestion and cleaning
- **Risk Calculation Module**: Implements institutional risk metrics and statistics
- **Technical Indicators Library**: Calculates multiple technical analysis signals
- **Backtesting Framework**: Simulates trading strategies with realistic constraints
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Creates comprehensive analytical charts and reports

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and statistical calculations
- **Matplotlib**: Advanced data visualization
- **yfinance**: Financial data retrieval
